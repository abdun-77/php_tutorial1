My first practical work on php login page.
First of all, all thanks is due to ALLAH Alone. I started this work in the year 2023 and Alhamduli LLAAHI (ALL PRAISE IS DUE TO ALLAH ALONE) I was able to design my willing or intended login/signup page that collects user's credentials (data) through a validation process and inserts properly submitted data into its corresponding table (entity or in "mango DB" known as collection) in a database. The login part of the system provides way to registered members in the signup page ( thus users that have their names in the database).
